Nothing to see here, just a project i made while learning magento. Its supposed to send email's to user after 24 hours they abandoned their shopping carts. Require working cron. Would be nice to include product images in mail but thats seems to be impossible in localhost due to images has to be hosted somewhere accessible wia internet, maybe i'll do it later anyway
